Currently I got the HTML file completed. I got the JScript file to work but I added a Jquery library that I import into my HTML file which is the main cause of the problem as to why the code doesnt work. My contracts seem to work because I can make transactions whenever I want but I can't implement it into my HTML file so the program doesn't work. I add the contract and address to my JScript file but it doesnt read it entirely so I think the problem is the JQuery file. 

Another issue I'm running into is not knowing where my address is going once I hit "add question" or "submit" so it means that my code is fine but something is wrong with the local host. We tried it putting it in a different host and something went wrong with MetaMask. I could'nt get the local host to change on metamask so the problem is somewhere in the jscript file because it doesn't seem to run. The issue it states is invalid address.
