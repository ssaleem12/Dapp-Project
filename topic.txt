For my project idea, I want to create a quiz game using HTML and smart contracts. The quiz will be about random knowledge (I haven't figured out what I want the quiz to be on). So for answering the question right, the player will get a point and once he reaches a number of points, he can create his own quesiton for the quiz but his points will go back to 0. I'm not sure if this will be complicated or not but I should add levels to this or penalize players for getting the answer wrong. If the player gets a number of questions wrong then he would be penalize in this case. This means that once you create a question, you have to make it hard so only you know the answer.
